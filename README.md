# Dapper Unit Of Work with Repository Pattern

This is a simple example of a Unit of Work with Repository Pattern for Dapper.

I created this repo because I could not find a repo pattern using unit of work with Dapper.  Hopefully this will help others looking to utilize Dapper in this way and work as a guide to start from.  There are tons of ways to implement this, so this is just one of those ways.

There is also a simple Dapper tutorial that shows the basic methods and how to use them for different scenarios along with a sample database.

Enjoy!
